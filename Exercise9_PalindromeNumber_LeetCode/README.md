<h1>Palindrome Number</h1>
<p>
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
</p>
<h2>Example 1:</h2>

Input: x = 121<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.<br>
<h2>Example 2:</h2>

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
